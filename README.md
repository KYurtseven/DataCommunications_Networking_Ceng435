# DataCommunications_Networking_Ceng435
Project for Ceng 435, Data Communications and Networking course

Project 1 is about sending a file using UDP.

## Abstract

In this project(1) we have designed a network which consists of a source node, a broker, 2 routers and a destination node. We have used Python programming language for implementing the design because of the ?exibility of the language. We have sent data from the source node to destination node and measured delays between packets sent and concluded that packets are lost and the delay is increased if the network becomes busy.

Project 2 is implementing TCP on top of UDP.
